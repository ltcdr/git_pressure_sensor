# Project PressureSensor
This is a description and collection of requirements for the project "Pressure Sensor".
It is an embedded C project which is focussed on the software development over the whole V-Cycle.
The project realizes a mobile device which measures the air pressure very often in order to visualize these data in a graph.

## Chapter 1: System Requirements
###### Description and requirements on system level
The system shall
- be small and portable
- run with a battery at least 3 hours

The system includes
- a microcontroller
- a sensor to measure the pressure

## Chapter 2: Software Requirements
The time interval for getting a pressure value from the sensor shall be adjustable via a parameter.
